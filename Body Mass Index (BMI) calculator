#Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (bmi) from a user's weight and height.
#The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m).
#Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.


height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")

#Check the type of height and weight. And as we can see they are strings 'str'.
#This one just for us, no need to code 2 strings below.
print(type(height))
print(type(weight))

#Write your code below this line
#Frirst we need to convert weight to integer 'int' (as it is in kg) and height to 'float' (as it is in meters).
bmi = int(weight)/ float(height) ** 2
#Then we need to convert float number bmi to whole number ('int').
bmi_int = int(bmi)
print(bmi_int)
