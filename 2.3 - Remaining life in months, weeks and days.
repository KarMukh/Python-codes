#Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
#It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format: You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
#There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
#Try copying the example output into your code and replacing the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.


age = input("What is your current age?")

#To check age type use print(type(age))
age_int = int(age)

#Write your code below this line
years_remaining = 90 - age_int

#print(years_remaining) to see if it is working
#print(type(years_remaining)) to check the type

months_remaining = years_remaining * 12
weeks_remaining = years_remaining * 52
days_remaining = years_remaining * 365

# F string allows us to do is in front of a string like this one, we type the character 'f' and you can start adding various values into this string. 
# You need to put variables inside a set of curly braces {}.
# F string format - instead of having to convert all of these and use a whole bunch of plus signs and then you have to convert everything into a string.

message = f"You have {days_remaining} days, {weeks_remaining} weeks, and {months_remaining} months left."
print(message)
