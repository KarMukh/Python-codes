#Lost in a maze
#Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. 
#The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.
#The functions move() and turn_left().
#Either the test front_is_clear() or wall_in_front(), right_is_clear() or wall_on_right(), and at_goal().
#How to use a while loop and if/elif/else statements.
#It might be useful to know how to use the negation of a test (not in Python).

#A robot located at (x, y) = (1, 5) carries no objects.
#Goal to achieve: The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = (6, 4)

#And the algorithm here is to simply follow along the right edge of the wall !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
#And if the right side is clear, then continue going right until it's no longer clear at which point it should just go straight. 
#And if you can't go straight and you can't go right, then the last option is to turn left.
#It's almost like the robot is getting a set of instructions in terms of hierarchy. 
#The most important telling it to turn right if it can, if it can't turn right then go straight ahead. 
#And finally, if it can't turn right or go straight ahead, then to turn left as a last resort.

def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
while front_is_clear():
    move()
turn_left()

# The description while front_is_clear() loop is below: the last group of comment.


while not at_goal():
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()
    else:
        turn_left()

#Now when our robot is able to go right, it will try to follow along the right wall.
#But when it can't go right, it will go forwards instead.
#And when it can't go right or go forward, then it's gonna turn left.

#But there are select cases where the robot might start out in a position and face a particular direction that gets the robot into an endless loop.
#And what happens is because the robot doesn't have a wall on it's right, it's going to keep looping through the circle because after all we're telling it if your right side is clear, turn right and move.

#The description while front_is_clear() loop:
#So if we create another while loop before this while loop runs, so remember the code goes from top to bottom, it's going to hit this while loop first.
#And we check while the front is clear, well then the robot is not next to a wall, right? 
#Once it's hit a wall, so it's exited this while loop, we're going to tell it to turn left.
