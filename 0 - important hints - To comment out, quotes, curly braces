## How do you round up a decimal number to the next whole number in Python?
## We have to import maths, and from the math module (we need to import it before the function ) and use a function called ceiling (ceil). 
## And then inside the parentheses, we can put in the inputs. 
## e.g. next_whole_num = math.ceil(decimal_num)
