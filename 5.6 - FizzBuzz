# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
#   And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
# Answer should start from 1 and go up to and including 100. Each number/text should be printed on a separate line.


for number in range(1, 101):
  
  #if number % 3 == 0  
  # elif number % 5 == 0
  # elif number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0
  ###So you might think that you could write the code like this, but there is a crucial problem in the logic here namely that we know that the if, elif, else statements will stop once it's found one statement that's true and skip the other ssteps.

# Instead we need to do following:

  if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  elif number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  else:
    print(number)
