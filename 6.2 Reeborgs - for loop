# Hurdles race
# Reeborg has entered a hurdles race. Make him run the course, following the path shown. 
#The functions move() and turn_left().
#You may have noticed that your solution has some repeated patterns. 
#If you know how to define functions, define a function named step() and use it to simplify your program.
#A robot located at (x, y) = (1, 1) carries no objects.
#Goal to achieve: The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = (13, 1)

# Instead of calling step() function 6 times I can use for loop:

for jump in range(6):
    step()


# So instead of calling step function six times, we could actually write a for loop that loops through and calls this step function six times.
# I'm going to use in range function. And I'm going to say from 0 to 6, but not including 6.
# And now I'm going to add the colon. And finally, inside this for loop, I'm going to call step just once. 

# Not about this code:
# To indent a banch of lines in windows we need to select the lines and then press Ctrl and ], and to bring back we need to press Ctrl and [
# To comment out a banch of lines in windows we need to select the lines and then either CTRL+SHIFT+/ or CTRL+/. I tried both, but not working. So need to chek
