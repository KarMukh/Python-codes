#Hurdles race
#Reeborg has entered a hurdle race, but he does not know in advance how long the race is. 
#Make him run the course, following a path similar to the one shown, but stopping at the only flag that will be shown after the race has started.
#The functions move() and turn_left().
#The condition at_goal() and its negation.
#How to use a while loop.
#Your program should also be valid for world Hurdles 1.
#A robot located at (x, y) = (1, 1) carries no objects.
#Goal to achieve: The final required position of the robot will be chosen at random.

#We need to delete or comment out for loop lines to start the while loop.

#Now you want to be using a while loop when you don't really care what number in a sequence you're in, 
#which item you're iterating through in a list and you just simply want to carry out some sort of functionality many, many times until some sort of condition that you set.

#But for loops are really great when you want to iterate over something and you need to do something with each thing that you are iterating over. 
#So for example, if you're iterating through a list and you're saying for each fruit in our list of fruits and you want to be able to say, do something with each of these items in here.
# For instance, it can be as simple as just printing it. So for range from one to six print each number in the range.
