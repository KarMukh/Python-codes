# Functions

print("Hello!")

number_of_characters = len("Hello!")
print(number_of_characters)

# print or len are build in functions in Python
# What if we wanted to make our own functions? How would we do that? Well, if we want to make our own function, we first start out with a keyword, which is called def. Here we're creating or defining our function. Below after def function comes the name of that function: my_function in this case. 
# So after the name comes the parentheses, and now the final thing, the finishing touch to our function definition is a colon because that says everything that comes after that line and is indented belongs with the function.

def my_function():
  print("Hello!")
  print("Bye")

# But if we run this code, actually nothing will happen. And the reason is because we haven't yet executed the function.
# We need to call the function, all we have to do is type the name of the function, which is my_function and then to add the parentheses and any necessary inputs. 

my_function()

#And now if I go ahead and run my code once more, then you'll see that by the time the computer reaches function"s line.
# It's going to search for this thing called my_ function. It sees that it was defined right here on line def function and it goes through all of the content and executes them in turn, line by line.
# And we call the function just by specifying the name and a set of parentheses.
# And once the computer sees this line of code it'll know to go and carry out all the instructions inside where we defined our function.


### In the console wil be printed:
### Hello
### Bye
