# Review: 
# Create a function called greet(). 
# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.


####But And then inside the parentheses, instead of leaving it blank, we get to create the name of the variable that's going to be passed over.
####It's going to be the name of the person that I wish to greet.
####

def greet_with_name(name):
  print(f"Hello {name}!")
  print(f"How are {name}?")
  print(f"See you {name}.")

### Now we can call the function and instead of variable name put a value for it, in this case "Karen".

greet_with_name("Karen")

### So this way we can create one function that carries out some instructions, but every time we execute it, it gets a modify it a little bit by changing the inputs.



#############################################


#Simple Function
def greet():
  print("Hello Angela")
  print("How do you do Jack Bauer?")
  print("Isn't the weather nice today?")
greet()


#### The result would be:
# Hello Angela
# How do you do Jack Bauer?
# Isn't the weather nice today?

#########################################

#Function that allows for input
#'name' is the parameter.
#'Jack Bauer' is the argument.
def greet_with_name(name):
  print(f"Hello {name}")
  print(f"How do you do {name}?")
greet_with_name("Jack Bauer")

### The result would be:
# Hello Jack Bauer
# How do you do Jack Bauer?


################################################

#Functions with more than 1 input
def greet_with(name, location):
  print(f"Hello {name}")
  print(f"What is it like in {location}?")

### The result would be:
# Hello Jack Bauer
# What is it like in Nowhere?

#Calling greet_with() with Positional Arguments
greet_with("Jack Bauer", "Nowhere")
#vs.
greet_with("Nowhere", "Jack Bauer")

#### But when we switch around our arguments, then the result would be for the switched one:
# Hello Nowhere
# What is it like in Jack Bauer?


#Calling greet_with() with Keyword Arguments
greet_with(location="London", name="Angela")

### But we can add the actual values for our parameters like we can see above name = "Angela" or location = "London".
### And now when we switch around the parameters, the result always gonna be the right one:
# Hello Angela
# What is it like in London?
