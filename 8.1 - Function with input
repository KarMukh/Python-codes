# Review: 
# Create a function called greet(). 
# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
# Call the greet() function and run your code.


####But And then inside the parentheses, instead of leaving it blank, we get to create the name of the variable that's going to be passed over.
####It's going to be the name of the person that I wish to greet.
####

def greet_with_name(name):
  print(f"Hello {name}!")
  print(f"How are {name}?")
  print(f"See you {name}.")

### Now we can call the function and instead of variable name put a value for it, in this case "Karen".

greet_with_name("Karen")

### So this way we can create one function that carries out some instructions, but every time we execute it, it gets a modify it a little bit by changing the inputs.
