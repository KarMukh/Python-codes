#If we use you’re in the string which of course starts with ‘ and ends same way and we use also “ ” symbols in the string too then we can get it to ignore a symbol ’ in you’re as a string ending symbol by using the backslash like this you\’re. So this way it basically escapes the string and it will see it as text and now we have a complete string, and this is just going to be interpreted as text because we told it to with the backslash. See the following example:

# choice1 = input('You\'re at a cross road. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right" \n').lower()

choice1 = input('You\'re at a cross road. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right" \n').lower()

# In this example \n at the end is for to print the answer from a new line and the .lower() is to change all the letters to the lower case for the program no matter how we’ve typed them, e.g Left, LEFT, left and so on.


#Remember the double equals is checking whether a left hand side and righthand side is equal and a single equal sign is assigning the right-hand side to this particular variable name.

if choice1 == "left":
  choice2 = input('You\'ve come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across. \n').lower()
  if choice2 == "wait":
    choice3 = input("You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose? \n").lower()
    if choice3 == "red":
      print("It's a room full of fire. Game Over.")
    elif choice3 == "yellow":
      print("You found the treasure! You Win!")
    elif choice3 == "blue":
      print("You enter a room of beasts. Game Over.")
    else:
      print("You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over.")
  else:
    print("You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over.")
else:
  print("You fell into a hole. Game Over.")
