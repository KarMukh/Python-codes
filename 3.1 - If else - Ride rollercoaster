#Print a program so that in order for somebody to actually purchase a ticket to go on the rollercoaster ride, they will need to be over 120 centimeters.

print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height > 120:
  print("You can ride the rollercoaster.")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
