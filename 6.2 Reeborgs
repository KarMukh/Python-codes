# Instead of calling step() function 6 times I can use for loop:

for jump in range(6):
    step()


# So instead of calling step function six times, we could actually write a for loop that loops through and calls this step function six times.
# I'm going to use in range function. And I'm going to say from 0 to 6, but not including 6.
# And now I'm going to add the colon. And finally, inside this for loop, I'm going to call step just once. 

# Not about this code:
# To indent a banch of lines in windows we need to select the lines and then press Ctrl and ], and to bring back we need to press Ctrl and [
# To comment out a banch of lines in windows we need to select the lines and then either CTRL+SHIFT+/ or CTRL+/. I tried both, but not working. So need to chek
