# List is constructed in following way: inside a set of square brackets separated by a comma.
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Apricot", "Peach", "Pear", "Oranges", "Dragon fruit", "Grapefruit"]

print(fruits)
# We can check the lengh of the list:
print(len(fruits))

print(fruits[0])
#0 printing first fruit in the list: Apple

print(fruits[-1])
# -1 printing the first one from the end in the list

fruits[-2] = "Cherry"
# This will change "Dragon fruit" in the list, which is the 2nd one from the end, to "Cherry".
print(fruits)
# We can check the lengh of the list:
print(len(fruits))


fruits.append("Lime")
#append add a single item to the end of the changed list.
print(fruits)
# We can check the lengh of the list:
print(len(fruits))

fruits.extend(["Pomelo", "Kumquat", "Lychee"])
# extend is for extending the list (in this case appended list) adding to it another list.
print(fruits)
# We can check the lengh of the list:
print(len(fruits))
