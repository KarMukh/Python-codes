# #Sample - the task was as following:
# #Write your code below this line 


# #Write your code above this line 
# # Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   

# # Don't change the code below 
# test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
# test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
# coverage = 5
# paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
###################################################################

#Write your code below this line 

import math
## See the description below why we imported math module.

#First we need to create a function
def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
  area = height*width
  num_of_cans = math.ceil(area/cover)
  print(f"You will need {num_of_cans} cans of paint.")

  ## As if this may be a decimal number we have two round it up to the next whole number.
  ## How do you round up a number in Python?
  ## We have to import maths, and from the math module (we need to import it before our def function if we want our function to be covered by it) and use a function called ceiling (ceil). And then inside the parentheses, we can put in the inputs. 

## So now when the code on line 37 calls paint_calc passing in each of its arguments, then it's going to be able to run our def function and print out how many cans of paint we will need. 
  
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)


#####
## The result on console gonna be:
## Height of wall: 7
## Width of wall: 11
## You will need 16 cans of paint.
