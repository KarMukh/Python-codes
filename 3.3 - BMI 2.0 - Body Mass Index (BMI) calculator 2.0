#Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
#It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value: under 18.5 they are underweight, over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight. 
# If they are over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight, over 30 but below 35 they are obese, above 35 they are clinically obese.
#Warning you should round the result to the nearest whole number. 
#The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m).
