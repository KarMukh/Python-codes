    ### Initial code with bugs:

# for number in range(1, 101):
#   if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
#     print("FizzBuzz")
#   if number % 3 == 0:
#     print("Fizz")
#   if number % 5 == 0:
#     print("Buzz")
#   else:
#     print([number])


##### In our code, if none of these if statements are true, then it prints the number. But in this case it's not just the number. There seems to be some square brackets around the number, in which case it's printing a list with that number as the single item inside. 

for number in range(1, 101):
  #or should be and
  if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  #if should be elif
  elif number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  #if should be elif
  elif number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    #This prints a list of number instead of just the number.
    print(number)
